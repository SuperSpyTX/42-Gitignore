These are .gitignore files, which will make certain git commands a lot easier instead of 
having to remember the files to turn in for each project.  This should make repositories on vogsphere a lot
cleaner and only have the files needed to be turned in.

Copy one of these files off this gist (< Command >< C >) (according to which project) and save it as ```.gitignore```


- **Make sure you're in the parent directory of all the exercises (or where .git exists!) - use cd otherwise!**
- ```vim .gitignore```
- Hit **i**
- < Command >< V >
- Save the file (ESC, :wq)

Now you can run ```git add .``` without git adding additional files that you don't need.

If you have extra files since this change, you can remove them from git manually, but that's a bit tricky.  

Let me know if you need help.
